                                                <p>This class is graded according to both productivity and creativity. The class is given a sculpture emphasis, and all works performed in this class are more challenging than those in the Foundations II class.
                                                    Students likely will create mobiles and other kinetics, wire and plaster sculptures, clay or seaweed castings and masks, wood carvings, assemblage, brick or Paper Mache’ reliefs, shadow boxes, and more.
                                                    Students are expected to research and expand their understanding of media as well as build their knowledge of historical influences that will enhance their projects. Students are challenged to develop
                                                    a critical eye for visual detail and a desire to price and sell their own art creations as inherent and reasonable to Visual Art Performance. OUTSIDE CLASS WORK IS REQUIRED, and students are expected
                                                    to carry cumbersome materials to and from school at times, in order to satisfactorily complete assignments. Tests and quizzes are inherent to the 3D Design experience.

                                                    focus of Drawing I is “MARK-MAKING” as opposed to DESIGN. Students are highly encouraged to take one or both (Drawing I and/or Foundations II) during their 9th grade year. It is especially important

                                            <p>Painting is an intermediate to advanced high school art class in which students develop skills in four major painting mediums. This is a challenging class and it requires good drawing skills; therefore, students
                                                are highly encouraged to take Drawing I either before or simultaneous to Painting I.</p>

                                                <p>Students will be graded according to productivity, execution, and level of competence. Students will build a portfolio of color, value, and technique studies and paintings AND will explore the four major
                                                    painting mediums. It is assumed that the painting student can work independently on drawings leading to a painting event. The painter MUST be able to act upon an internal drive to find and research ideas,
                                                    which contribute to a painting’s meaning and content-via the library, the Internet, magazines, the news, and/or their own photography. The Painting I student should NOT largely depend on the first time
                                                    teaching of basic drawing concepts to achieve stronger compositions. Students are challenged to develop a critical eye for visual detail and a desire to price and sell their own art creations as an inherent
                                                    and reasonable reality to Visual Art Performance. Due to the cost of paints and quality brushes, student’s who exhibit less than mature handling of painting supplies and equipment will be excused from
                                                    the course to make room for others on a waiting list who are more efficient in managing their work decisions. OUTSIDE CLASS WORK IS EXPECTED. Tests and quizzes are inherent to the Painting I experience.

                                                creation of more substantive paintings. Paintings will be completed in oils, watercolor, acrylics, and tempera. Painting II provides an independent component for each student to research content, explore
                                                media, and investigate visual concepts in which the student has a more personal and vested interest. The Painting II student will identify a painting media preference to complete a minimum of 3 or more complex
                                                and sophisticated paintings each quarter, although painting sketches and exercises are likely the lead-up to the three. It is highly encouraged that the Painting II student will strive for the completion
                                                of show paintings to be juried for exhibit in show venues, though not a mandate for taking the class.</p>

                                            <p>This course places a strong emphasis on acting as an ensemble, working as a group, and the exploration of all design elements. Students will gain knowledge and respect for all areas of the theatre including:
                                                performance, design, tech work, directing, and playwriting. There are many opportunities provided through this class to perform, design, and work tech/crew including school plays, in-class performance, and
                                                competition.</p>
