                                                    are introduced so that all quadratic equations can be solved. The link between probability and data is explored through conditional probability and counting methods, including their use in making and
                                                    evaluating decisions. The study of similarity leads to an understanding of right triangle trigonometry and connects to quadratics through Pythagorean relationships. Students will develop facility with
                                                    geometric proof. They use what they know about congruence and similarity to prove theorems involving lines, angles, triangles, and other polygons. They explore a variety of formats for writing proofs.
                                                    Circles, with their quadratic algebraic representations, round out the course. Students develop informal arguments justifying common formulas for circumference, area, and volume of geometric objects,
                                                    especially those related to circles. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent,
                                                    useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations. They expand their experience with functions to include more specialized functions—absolute value, step,
                                                    and those that are piece wise-defined.
