  <h2> <a name="art" id="art"></a>Art &amp; Photography</h2>
  <p>Yosemite has long been a haven for artists and photographers, and many artists have played a role--directly or indirectly--in the promotion and protection of Yosemite.  </p>
  <p>Free art classes are offered spring through fall at the Yosemite Art and Education Center in Yosemite Valley. Supplies can also be purchased there.  </p>
  <p>Free photography walks are offered all year (check Yosemite Guide for listings).  </p>
  <p>The Yosemite Museum Gallery displays exhibits of Yosemite art during spring and summer (check Yosemite Guide for listings).</p>
  <p> The Ansel Adams Gallery offers work of Ansel Adams, contemporary photographers, and other fine artists. In addition, a wide selection of handcrafts, books, gifts, and photography supplies is available.  </p>
  <p>The Yosemite Association's Outdoor Adventures program offers art and photography seminars throughout the park.  </p>
  <p>The Yosemite Renaissance offers an artist-in-residence program. </p>

  <h2><a name="birdwatching" id="birdwatching"></a>Birdwatching  </h2>
  <p>Yosemite National Park provides essential habitat for about 165 species of migrating, wintering, and breeding birds, in addition to another 91 species recorded as transient or vagrant. Designated a World Heritage Site and an Important Bird Area, the park harbors diverse avian assemblages and habitats, numerous bird species of special concern, and prized habitat ranging from gently sloping foothill grasslands, through chaparral/oak woodland and giant conifer forests, up to windswept alpine meadows and peaks. </p>
  <p>The most regularly seen resident birds include Steller's jay, American robin, acorn woodpecker, common raven, and mountain chickadee. In spring, look for the bright red wing patches on the red-winged blackbird (most often seen in wet meadows) or the tropical looking western tanager foraging in the conifers. Near rivers and streams, watch the american dipper dart in and out of rapids and listen for their beautiful melodious song.  </p>
  <p>Some of the more sought-after birds to see in Yosemite include the great gray owl, spotted owl, peregrine falcon, pileated woodpecker, and northern goshawk.  </p>
  <p>In general, quiet forests and meadows away from developed areas (particularly in the mornings) are the best places to see some of the less common birds. Keep in mind basic birding etiquette; tread lightly and quietly and please follow park rules by refraining from using broadcast bird calls to elicit responses. </p>

  <h2><a name="climbing" id="climbing"></a>Rock Climbing  </h2>
  <p>Yosemite is one of the world's greatest climbing areas. Climbers here can enjoy an endless variety of challenges--from the sustained crack climbs of the Merced River Canyon to pinching crystals on sun-drenched Tuolumne Meadows domes to multi-day aid climbs on the big walls of the Valley. Yosemite is not just a climber's playground, however: its walls and crags are an integral part of a larger ecosystem, protected as Wilderness, which was set aside for people to enjoy in a natural state for generations to come.</p>
  <p>As the number of climbers visiting the park has increased through the years, the impacts of climbing have become much more obvious. Some of those impacts include: soil compaction, erosion, and vegetation loss in parking areas, at the base of climbs, and on approach and descent trails, destruction of cliffside vegetation and lichen, disturbance of cliff-dwelling animals, litter, water pollution from improper human waste disposal, and the visual blight of chalk marks, pin scars, bolts, rappel slings, and fixed ropes. Many of these impacts can be eliminated or greatly reduced by following the minimum impact practices outlined in the conservation guidelines offered on this page. The impacts of your actions may seem insignificant, but when multiplied by the thousands of people who climb here every year they can have a significant, long lasting effect.</p>
  <p> Your help is needed to ensure that Yosemite remains a beautiful and healthy place for the future.</p>
  <h3>Safety</h3>
  <p>More than 100 climbing accidents occur in Yosemite each year; of these, 15-25 parties require a rescue. Climbing in Yosemite has inherent risks and climbers assume complete responsibility for their own safety. The National Park Service does not maintain routes; loose rock and other hazards can exist on any route. Rescue is not a certainty. If you get into difficulties, be prepared to get yourself out of them. Know what to do in any emergency, including injuries, evacuations, unplanned bivouacs, or rapid changes in weather. Safety depends on having the right gear and the right attitude. Practice self-rescue techniques before you need them! Courtesy is an element of safety. Falling rock or gear is a serious hazard. Be careful when climbing above others. Do not create a dangerous situation by passing another party without their consent. Be sure to read the section on &quot;Staying Alive&quot; in the Yosemite Valley guidebook.</p>
  <h3> Emergency Information</h3>
  <p>The Yosemite Medical Clinic, located between Yosemite Village and The Ahwahnee, is equipped to handle climbing injuries. If you cannot get to the clinic on your own, call 911 for assistance. If you are injured or stranded while on a climb and cannot self-rescue, yell for help to obtain assistance. If you require a helicopter evacuation, do only and exactly what you are told by rescue personnel.</p>
  <h3>Wilderness Permits  </h3>
  <p>At the current time, wilderness permits are not required for nights spent on a wall. It is illegal to camp at the base of any wall in Yosemite Valley. Camping at the base of Half Dome is legal, but a wilderness permit is required. To have the best chance of getting one, go there early in the morning the day before you hike up. Camping on the summit of Half Dome is prohibited.</p>
  <h3>Conservation/Regulations</h3>
  <p>Fight litter! Don't toss anything off a wall, even if you intend to pick it up later. Don't leave food or water at the top or on ledges for future parties. Set a good example by picking up any litter you see, including tape wads and cigarette butts.  </p>
  <p>Don't leave fixed ropes as permanent fixtures on approaches and descents. These are considered abandoned property and will be removed.  </p>
  <p>Minimize erosion on your approach and descent. If an obvious main trail has been created, use it. Go slow on the way down to avoid pushing soil down the hill. Avoid walking on vegetation whenever possible.  </p>
  <p>If you need to build a fire for survival during an unplanned bivouac on the summit, use an existing fire ring. Building a new fire ring or windbreak is prohibited. Make sure your fire is completely out before you leave.  </p>
  <p>Clean extra, rotting slings off anchors when you descend. Bring earth-toned slings to leave on anchors.</p>
  <p> Check the Camp 4 kiosk or the Mountain Shop for the current Peregrine Falcon closures.</p>

  <h2><a name="water" id="water"></a>Water Activities</h2>
  <h3>Swimming  </h3>
  <p>Besides the outdoor pools available to the public during summer at Curry Village and Yosemite Lodge swimming is permitted in all bodies of water in the park except Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and above waterfalls. Swimming in the Merced River is a great way to cool off--but help protect the river by entering and exiting only on sandy beaches. Swimming in rivers is not without hazards, including swift currents, cold water, and hazards within the river (e.g., trees). See Water Safety for more information.  </p>
  <h3>Rafting  </h3>
  <p>Rafting along the Merced River is popular during summer. You can rent a raft (typically in June and July, but it varies from year to year, depending on water level) or bring your own. (Other nonmotorized vessels, such as kayaks, are also permitted.)  </p>
  <p>Rafting is permitted on the Merced River between Stoneman Bridge (near Curry Village) and Sentinel Beach Picnic Area between 10 am and 6 pm under the following conditions: the river stage (depth) must read less than 6.5 feet at Sentinel Bridge and the sum of air temperature and water temperature must be more than 100Â°F. You must have a personal flotation device immediately available for each occupant of the raft.  Rafting is also permitted on the South Fork of the Merced River in the Wawona area.  </p>
  <p>Some visitors also enjoy kayaking the calm waters of Tenaya Lake. </p>
  <h3>Fishing   </h3>
  <p>Fishing regulations for Yosemite National Park follow those set by the State of California, including the requirement that people 16 or older have a valid California fishing license.  </p>
  <p>The season for stream and river fishing begins on the last Saturday in April and continues through November 15. The only exception is Frog Creek near Lake Eleanor, where fishing season does not open until June 15 to protect spawning rainbow trout. The late opening includes the first 1/2 mile of Frog Creek up to the first waterfall, including the pool below this waterfall. The late opening also extends 200 feet from the mouth of Frog Creek out onto the surface of Lake Eleanor and along its shore for a distance of 200 feet from the creek's mouth.  Otherwise, all lakes and reservoirs are open to fishing year-round.  </p>
  <p>There are some special regulations that apply within the park:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No live or dead minnows or other bait fish, amphibians, non-preserved fish eggs, or roe may be used or possessed.    </li>
    <li> Fishing from bridges and docks is prohibited. </li>
    <li> Rainbow trout are catch-and-release only. </li>
    <li> Mirror Lake is considered a stream and is only open during stream fishing season. </li>
    <li> Maximum size limit of 12 inches in total length. </li>
  </ul>
<p><a href="#doTop" target="_self">{Back to Top}</a></p>
