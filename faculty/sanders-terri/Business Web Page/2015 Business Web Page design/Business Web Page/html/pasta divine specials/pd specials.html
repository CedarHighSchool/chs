<strong> Fettuccini Alfredo</strong>
<p><img src="fettuccine.jpg" align="left" alt="fettuccini" width="212" height="203" hspace="5"/> </p>
<p>Our fettuccine alfredo dish is a traditional Italian recipe your family will love!  The secret is our rich fettuccine alfredo sauce.  The sauce is what makes this dish so pupular.  The alfredo sauce recipe comes from the Lazio area of Italy.  The cream cheese that we use in our sauce is the best that is made, and that adds to the creamy richness.  Because this fettuccine dish is so simple, it's important to use good-quality ingredients.</p>

<strong> Lasagna</strong> 
<p><img src="lasagna.jpg" alt="lasagna" align="right" width="308" height="205" hspace="5" /> </p>
<p>Lasagna was Grandpa Salvatore's favorite dish.  His mother used to make lasagna for the whole neighbrohood back in the Toscana area of Italy where she grew up.  Our lasagna is brimming with a spiced beef and pork filling mixed with our secret marinara sauce.</p>
<p>For lighter fare, you can choose our vegetable lasagna.  This healthy meal is filled with a mix of fresh vegetables together with the same marinara sauce.</p>

<strong> Ravioli</strong>
<p><img src="ravioli.jpg" alt="ravioli" align="left" height="260" width="200" hspace="5" /> </p>
<p> Ravioli is traditionally two pieces of this pasta dough filled with meat, cheese or vegetables.  Our ravioli comes from the Umbria area of Italy where they mix the filling with a rich pesto sauce combined with warm yogurt.  This makes the ravioli creamy as well as mouthwatering.</p>
<p>You can order our ravioli as prepared or purchase frozen ravioli to make later.  Either way, this dish is an award-winner.</p>
