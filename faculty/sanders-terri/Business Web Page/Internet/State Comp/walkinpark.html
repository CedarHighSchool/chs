<Font face="arial" color="#663333" size="2">Stand at the base of a coast <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/redw/">redwood</A> and the huckleberry bushes tower over you. Watch statuesque Roosevelt elk grazing in the prairies. Observe the tail of a female Chinook salmon heave skyward as she makes a nest for her eggs. Whether a morning or night person, you can hear the endangered marbled murrelets' keer across the treetops as they fly from sea to mossy nest. 
<P>
Not just a great Valley...but a shrine to human foresight, strength of granite, power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra. <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/yose/">Yosemite National Park</A>, one of the first wilderness parks in the United States, is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.
<P>
Massive canyon walls ascend toward a brilliant blue sky. To experience <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/zion">Zion</A>, you need to walk among the towering cliffs, or challenge your courage in a small narrow canyon. These unique sandstone cliffs range in color from cream, to pink, to red. They could be described as sand castles crowning desert canyons.
