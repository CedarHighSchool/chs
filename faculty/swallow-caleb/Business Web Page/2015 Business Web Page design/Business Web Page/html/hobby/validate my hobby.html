<p> I like to can because I enjoy using <font size="+3"face="comic sans"> fresh vegetables</font>.  I think fresh food tastes much better than what is in a can.  I used to think that canning saved money, though I'm not sure that is really true anymore.  I do buy some things at case lot sales, but I have certain recipes that I think taste better homemade.  I can mostly <font face="Cambria" size="+2"> green beans and tomatoes (salsa, diced tomatoes, and sauced.)</font>  I have also canned <font color="#000077"> pickles, peaches, pears, applesauce and apple pie filling. </font> </p>
