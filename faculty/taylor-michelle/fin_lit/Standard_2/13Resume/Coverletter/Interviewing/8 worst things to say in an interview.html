  8 worst things to say in an interview

    * Story Highlights
    * Research the company beforehand to avoid looking unprepared or
      uninterested
    * Talking about what days off you'll need should wait until after
      you get the job
    * Ask about the typical career path rather than when you'll get a
      promotion
    * Don't cross the line into too personal subjects when talking with
      an employer

By Anthony Balderrama

Interviews are nothing if not opportunities to drive yourself crazy.

Just remind yourself to look good, appear confident, say all the right
things and don't say any of the wrong ones.

It shouldn't be so hard to follow these guidelines except you'll be on
the receiving end of an endless line of questions. Factor in your nerves
and you'll be lucky to remember your own name.

Don't fret.

If you walk into the interview prepared, you can make sure you know what
right things to say, and you can stop yourself from saying the following
wrong things.

*1. "I hated my last boss."* Your last boss was a miserable person whose
main concern was making your life miserable. Of course you don't have a
lot of nice things to say; however, don't mistake honesty, which is
admirable, for trash-talking, which is despicable.

"If you truly did hate your last boss, I would be prepared to articulate
why your last organization and relationship was not right for you," says
Greg Moran, director of industry sales and partnerships for Talent
Technology Corp. "Then be prepared to explain what type of organization
is right for you and what type of management style you best respond to."

*2. "I don't know anything about the company."* Chances are the
interviewer will ask what you know about the company. If you say you
don't know anything about it, the interviewer will wonder why you're
applying for the job and will probably conclude you're after money, not
a career.

"With today's technology," Moran says, "there is no excuse for having no
knowledge of a company except laziness and/or poor planning -- neither
of which are attributes [of potential employees] sought by many
organizations."

*3. "No, I don't have any questions for you."* Much like telling the
interviewer that you don't know anything about the company, saying you
don't have any questions to ask also signals a lack of interest. Perhaps
the interviewer answered every question or concern you had about the
position, but if you're interested in a future with this employer, you
can probably think of a few things to ask.

"Research the company before you show up," Moran advises. "Understand
the business strategy, goals and people. Having this type of knowledge
will give you some questions to keep in your pocket if the conversation
is not flowing naturally."

*4. "I'm going to need to take these days off."* "We all have lives and
commitments and any employer that you would even consider working for
understands this. If you progress to an offer stage, this is the time
for a discussion regarding personal obligations," Moran suggests. "Just
don't bring it up prior to the salary negotiation/offer stage."

Why? By mentioning the days you need off too early in the interview, you
risk coming off presumptuous as if you know you'll get the job.

*5. "How long until I get a promotion?"* While you want to show that
you're goal-oriented, be certain you don't come off as entitled or ready
to leave behind a job you don't even have yet.

"There are many tactful ways to ask this question that will show an
employer that you are ambitious and looking at the big picture," Moran
offers. "For example, asking the interviewer to explain the typical
career path for the position is fine."

Another option is to ask the interviewer why the position is open, Moran
adds. You might find out it's due to a promotion and can use that
information to learn more about career opportunities.

*6. "Are you an active member in your church?"* As you attempt to make
small talk with an interviewer, don't cross the line into inappropriate
chitchat. Avoid topics that are controversial or that veer too much from
work.

"This sounds obvious but many times I have been interviewing candidates
and been asked about my personal hobbies, family obligations, et
cetera," Moran says. "Attempting to develop a rapport is essential but
taking it too far can bring you into some uncomfortable territory."

*7. "As Lady Macbeth so eloquently put it..."* Scripted answers,
although accurate, don't impress interviewers. Not only do they make you
sound rehearsed and stiff, they also prevent you from engaging in a
dialogue.

"This is a conversation between a couple humans that are trying to get a
good understanding of one another. Act accordingly," Moran reminds.

*8. "And another thing I hate..."* Save your rants for your blog. When
you're angry, you don't sway anybody's opinion about a topic, but you do
make them like you less. For one thing, they might disagree with you.
They also won't take kindly to your bad attitude.

"If you are bitter, keep it inside and show optimism. Start complaining
and you will be rejected immediately," Moran warns. "Do you like working
with a complainer? Neither will the interviewer."
