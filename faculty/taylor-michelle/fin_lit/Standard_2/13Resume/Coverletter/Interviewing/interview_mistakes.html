We've all heard stories of job candidates who looked great on paper but
who were absolute disasters in person. With fewer and fewer interview
opportunities available in this competitive market, it's essential to
make the best possible first impression. You can learn from the mistakes
of others and avoid the top 10 worst interview blunders.

*Poor handshake:* The three-second handshake that starts the interview
is your first opportunity to create a great impression. But all too
often an interview is blown right from the start by an ineffective
handshake. Once you've delivered a poor handshake, it's nearly
impossible to recover your efforts to build rapport. Here are some
examples:

    * The Limp Hand (or "dead fish"): Gives the impression of
      disinterest or weakness
    * The Tips of the Fingers: Shows lack of ability to engage.
    * The Arm Pump: Sincerity is questionable, much like an overly
      aggressive salesman. 

Even if you're a seasoned professional, don't assume you have avoided
these pitfalls. Your handshake may be telling more about you than you
know. Ask for honest critiques from several friends who aren't afraid to
tell you the truth.

*Talking too much:* In my recruiting days, I abhorred over-talkative
candidates. So did most of my client employers. Over-talking takes a
couple of forms:

    * Taking too long to answer direct questions. The impression: This
      candidate just can't get to the point.
    * Nervous talkers. The impression: This candidate is covering up
      something or is outright lying. 

To avoid either of these forms of over-talking, practice answering
questions in a direct manner. Avoid nervous talking by preparing for
your interview with role-play

*Talking negatively about current or past employers/managers:* The
fastest way to talk yourself out of a new job is to say negative things.
Even if your last boss was Attila the Hun, never, never state your ill
feelings about him/her. No matter how reasonable your complaints, /you/
will come out the loser if you show that you disrespect your boss
because the interviewer will assume that you would similarly trash him
or her. When faced with the challenge of talking about former employers,
make sure you are prepared with a positive spin on your experiences.

*Showing up late or too early:* One of the first lessons in job-search
etiquette is to show up on time for interviews. Many job-seekers don't
realize, however, that showing up too early often creates a poor first
impression as well. Arriving more than 10 minutes early for an interview
is a dead giveaway that the job seeker has too much time on his or her
hands, much like the last one picked for the softball team. Don't
diminish your candidate desirability by appearing desperate. Act as if
your time were as valuable as the interviewer's. Always arrive on time,
but never more than 10 minutes early.

*Treating the receptionist rudely:* Since the first person you meet on
an interview is usually a receptionist, this encounter represents the
first impression you'll make. Don't mistake low rank for low input.
Often that receptionist's job is to usher you into your interview. The
receptionist has the power to pave your way positively or negatively
before you even set eyes on the interviewer. The interviewer may also
solicit the receptionist's opinion of you after you leave.

*Asking about benefits, vacation time or salary:* What if a car salesman
asked to see your credit report before allowing you to test drive the
cars? That would be ridiculous, and you'd walk away in disgust. The
effect is about the same when a job-seeker asks about benefits or other
employee perks during the first interview. Wait until you've won the
employer over before beginning that discussion.

*Not preparing for the interview*: Nothing communicates disinterest like
a candidate who hasn't bothered to do pre-interview research. On the
flip side, the quickest way to a good impression is to demonstrate your
interest with a few well thought out questions that reflect your
knowledge of their organization. [Editor's note: To ensure that you are
prepared, see our article, The Ultimate Guide to Job Interview
Preparation <http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interview_preparation.html>.]

*Verbal ticks*: An ill-at-ease candidate seldom makes a good impression.
The first signs of nervousness are verbal ticks. We all have them from
time to time -- "umm," "like," "you know." Ignore the butterflies in
your stomach and put up a front of calm confidence by avoiding verbal
ticks. You can also sometimes avoid verbal ticks by pausing for a few
seconds to gather your thoughts before each response.

One of the best ways to reduce or eliminate them is through role-play.
Practice sharing your best success stories ahead of time, and you'll
feel more relaxed during the real interview.

*Not enough/too much eye contact:* Either situation can create a
negative effect. Avoid eye contact and you'll seem shifty, untruthful,
or disnterested; offer too much eye contact, and you'll wear the
interviewer out. If you sometimes have trouble with eye-contact balance,
work this issue out ahead of time in an interview practice session with
a friend.

*Failure to match communication styles:* It's almost impossible to make
a good first impression if you can't communicate effectively with an
interviewer. But you can easily change that situation by mirroring the
way the interviewer treats you. For instance:

    * If the interviewer seems all business, don't attempt to loosen
      him/her up with a joke or story. Be succinct and businesslike
    * If the interviewer is personable, try discussing his/her
      interests. Often the items on display in the office can offer a clue.
    * If asked a direct question, answer directly. Then follow up by
      asking if more information is needed. 

Allowing the interviewer to set the tone of conversation can vastly
improve your chances of making a favorable impression. You can put the
interviewer at ease -- and make yourself seem more like him or her -- by
mirroring his or her communication style.

*Final Thoughts*
Just as a strong resume wins you an opportunity to interview, strong
interview skills will win you consideration for the job. You already
know that you won't earn an interview unless your resume sets you apart
as a candidate of choice. Similarly, you should know that polishing your
interview skills can mean the difference between getting the job offer
-- and being a runner-up.

Start your job search with a resume that creates a stellar first
impression, then back those facts up with your extraordinary interview
skills. You will have made yourself a better candidate by avoiding these
ten interview pitfalls. And no one will have to talk about you as the
candidate who "almost" got the job.
