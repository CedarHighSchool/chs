			      		<p>Teacher Permission Required<br>
			      		  This course involves the preparation and performance of a  variety of styles of band music. Symphonic Band is for more experienced<br>
			      		  players who have played their instruments for several years  and have achieved a degree of excellence. The students are expected to play<br>
			      		  more advanced literature, along with practicing their  instrument everyday. Band members are expected to maintain a high G.P.A.,<br>
			      		  while attending all band functions and trips. Marching Band  is part of the Symphonic Band curriculum. Each member will need to<br>
			      		  purchase a band shirt for parades, or provide their own  white golf style shirt. In addition to the band shirt, black dress pants, black  socks<br>
			      		  and black shoes are required for marching band. Male members  will be checked out a concert tuxedo and will be responsible for its<br>
			      		  maintenance and dry cleaning. Female members will need to  provide their own modest BLACK dress for festivals and performances.<br>
			      		  There will be several overnight trips involved for  participation in festivals and clinics.</p>
